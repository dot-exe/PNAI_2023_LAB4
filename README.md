To make sure migration was done properly follow these steps:
+ `cd biblioteka`
+ `python manage.py makemigrations`
+ `python manage.py migrate`
+ `python manage.py showmigrations`
  + at this point, if one of the migrations are not checked, consider remove your `db.sqlite3` database file. It is highly probable that your data does not match models from previous stage of this project. After removing the database, do `makemigrations` and `migrate` once again.

## Run project

+ Open terminal and go to the directory with `manage.py` script
  + `cd biblioteka`
+ Make migration of your models to a database
  + `python manage.py makemigrations`
  + then `python manage.py migrate`
+ If migration ended succesfully (you should have `migrations` folder in your `katalog` app)
  + `python manage.py runserver`

After running your app, the main part will be available at `https:localhost:8000/katalog/`, the admin panel is running at `https:localhost:8000/admin/`
